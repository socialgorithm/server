```

### Publishing packages

#### From Github Actions

If you are releasing a patch version (no breaking changes), simply trigger the [Create patch and publish to NPM](https://github.com/socialgorithm/server/actions/workflows/npm-patch-publish.yml) Github actions workflow.

#### From command line

Increment the version:
```
npm run version:prompt
```

This will prompt you to choose the type of the next version (e.g. patch, minor, major)

Publish the new package:
```
npm run publish
```

This will publish the version in NPM.

You can also publish a prerelease tag to test changes:

```
npm run publish:prerelease
```
